    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</p>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you
        make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
        you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence
        of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves,
        though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning
        with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
        recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
        choice
        that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there
        are no
        good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <center><img src="treesearch.gif" alt=""></center>
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li> At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li> D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices
        we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell
        us
        what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called
        <i><strong>depth-first-tree searching</strong></i>)</p>
    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
    <font size="4" color="red">
        <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    </pre>
    </font>

    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i> boolean</i> function. This is essential to understanding the
        algorithm.
        If <font size="4" color="red">solve(n)</font> is true, that means node <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is
        part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from
        the root to some goal node. We say that n is <i>solvable.</i> If <font size="4" color="red">solve(n)</font> is
        false, then there is no path that includes
        <font size="4" color="red">n</font>to any goal node.
    </p>
    <p>How does it work?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is solvable, then <font size="4" color="red">n</font>is
            solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is solvable, then <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is
            not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is solvable (part of a path to a
        goal node), all you have to do is
        test whether any child of <font size="4" color="red">n</font> is solvable. This is done recursively, on each
        child of <font size="4" color="red">n</font>. In the above code, this is
        done by the lines
    </p>
    <font size="4" color="red">
        <pre>
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if
        the
        leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the
        lines
    </p>
    <font size="4" color="red">
        <pre>
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }            
        </pre>
    </font>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of
        stating it is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To search a tree:</li>
        <ol>
            <li> If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have
                searched them all unsuccessfully.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they
        can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: for
        example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate
        and stalemate solutions.
    </p>
    <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example,
        you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <font size="4" color="red">gameOver</font> method (or you
        could even call it <font size="4" color="red">isLeaf)</font>.
        This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its
        children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look
        simple, by just saying for <font size="4" color="red">each child c of n</font>. In reality, it may be difficult
        to figure out what the possible
        children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can
        represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the
        arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep
        track of which ones you've already examined?
    </p>
    <p>
        The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon
        initial entry to the node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
        you try
        each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can
        return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.
    </p>
    <p>children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try
        next.<br>
        For example, you might be able to number the children <font size="4" color="red">1</font> through <font size="4"
            color="red">n</font>, and try them in numerical order. Then, if
        you have just tried child <font size="4" color="red">k</font>, you know that you have already tried children
        <font size="4" color="red">1</font> through <font size="4" color="red">k1</font>, and you have not
        yet tried children <font size="4" color="red">k+1</font> through <font size="4" color="red">n</font>. Or, if you
        are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try
        red first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you
        are
        searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right (or perhaps north, east, south, west).

    <h3>Example: TreeSearch</h3>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will
        also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <b>binary tree</b> is a data structure composed of <b>nodes</b>. One node is designated as the <b>root
            node</b>. Each node can
        reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its <b>children</b>. The children are
        referred to as
        the <b>left child</b> and/or the <b>right child</b>. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the
        root node, and
        there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say
        that
        a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we
        repeat here) shows a binary tree.
    </p>
    <center><img src="treesearch.gif" alt=""></center>
    <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
    <pre>
        <font size="4" color="red">
            public class BinaryTree {
                BinaryTree leftChild = nullÍ¾
                BinaryTree rightChild = nullÍ¾
                boolean isGoalNode = falseÍ¾
                String nameÍ¾
                
                BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                    this.name = nameÍ¾
                    leftChild = leftÍ¾
                    rightChild = rightÍ¾
                    this.isGoalNode = isGoalNodeÍ¾
                }
            }
        </font>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Next we will create a <font size="4" color="red">TreeSearch</font> class, and in it we will define a method
        makeTree() which constructs
        the above binary tree.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <font size="4" color="red">
            static BinaryTree makeTree() {
                BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, fÍ¾
                c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false)Í¾
                d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false)Í¾
                e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true)Í¾
                f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false)Í¾
                a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false)Í¾
                b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false)Í¾
                root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false)Í¾
                return rootÍ¾
            }
        </font>
    </pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <pre>
        <font size="4" color="red">
            public static void main(String args[]) {
                BinaryTree tree = makeTree()Í¾
                System.out.println(solvable(tree))Í¾
            }
            
        </font>
    </pre>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <pre>
        <font size="4" color="red">
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
               <font color="blue"> /* 1 */ </font>if (node == null) return falseÍ¾
               <font color="blue"> /* 2 */ </font>if (node.isGoalNode) return trueÍ¾
               <font color="blue"> /* 3 */ </font>if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return trueÍ¾
               <font color="blue"> /* 4 */ </font>if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return trueÍ¾
               <font color="blue"> /* 5 */ </font>return falseÍ¾
                }  
        </font>
    </pre>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the
            children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist
        </li>
        <li>
            If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.
        </li>
        <li>
            See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to
            this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node, says to
        </li>
        <li>
            Do the same thing for the right child.
        </li>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information
        suggests otherwise

    <p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).
        At each move, a marble can either:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
        <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.

    </ol>
    <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in
        the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always
        produces its results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the
        results again to get them in the correct order.
